            Hi I am a 16. I live in Sylvania, Ohio. I live with my Mom, Dad and 3 siblings. I go to Northview High School. I am currently a Junior. I work a kroger and wored as a busser at a restaurant. After Highschool I will go to college for sometype of a software degree. Also i either at 18 or 19 will work with my dad at Energy Transfer as a operator. The job will pay for college and have a salary around 100k. Software really only interests me becasue the job field pays a very good amount.
